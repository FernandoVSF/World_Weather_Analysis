# World_Weather_Analysis
Analysis of World data using Python, Jupyter and Pandas

## Overview of the analysis
Adding the weather description to the weather data retrieved in the module. Then, have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.  The following tasks will be performed:

- Retrieve Weather Data
- Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
- Create a Travel Itinerary Map
